There’s never been a change on the scale of Ethereum’s transition from proof of work to proof of stake: analyst. ",6 Apr 2022  13:37,"Sometime later this year, Ethereum is set to make the biggest change in its near-decade history, an event that’s certain to ripple through the entire ecosystem of cryptocurrencies and digital assets.

Think of it this way: The most important commercial highway in crypto is about to be completely repaved.

Ethereum is essentially computer software that uses so-called blockchain technology to provide a digital ledger for recording transactions. It’s become the most popular basis for a growing array of commercial crypto assets and applications, including lending products, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), as well as its native token, Ether.

Ethereum isn’t owned by anyone but built and refined by a community of developers, and it runs on a network of data centers throughout the world. These data centers operate as “miners” on the network, ordering transactions that are posted to the digital ledger. In return they get paid in Ether. This system has been dubbed “proof of work.”

Developers who work on refining the Ethereum software roll out periodic upgrades, but none has been as major as the one expected this year. Named “the Merge,” it will replace miners with so-called stakers. Miners order transactions by solving complex calculations using millions of powerful servers—a system that’s been criticised for its heavy use of electricity. Stakers, by contrast, will order transactions by putting up their own Ether on a new system, which has been in testing since December 2020.

People can already use their digital wallets to stake Ether on this test system, called the Beacon Chain; after the Merge they will start to be selected at random to become what are known as validators, ordering transactions on the Ethereum digital ledger into blocks and getting paid with new Ether. This is called “proof of stake.” 


Market cap

Ethereum’s $415.3 billion market capitalisation depends on the Merge going smoothly, but so do the thousands of businesses that operate on the blockchain, plus millions of users. Some $121.5 billion of capital is locked in Ethereum’s decentralised finance (DeFi) apps, according to tracker DappRadar. Most NFTs—also with a total value in the billions—use Ethereum.

“There’s never been, in the history of blockchain networks, a change on the scale of Ethereum’s transition from proof of work to proof of stake,” says Chase Devens, an analyst at researcher Messari.

The Merge will be a nail-biter because a lot could go wrong. 
There could be software bugs or hacks, or miners could create an alternative Ethereum network. During a 2020 network upgrade, a bug split Ethereum in two, wreaking havoc on its nascent DeFi ecosystem, the apps that let people trade, borrow, and lend without intermediaries like banks.

Most centralised crypto exchanges are expected to pause Ether withdrawals and deposits around the Merge as a precaution. DeFi apps may pause, too, if something goes wrong. 
“With all technical upgrades of all these large chains, you need to use caution,” says Katie Talati, director of research at digital asset manager Arca. “At the end of the day we are dealing with unknown technology.”

The miners are causing the most worries.

Many may quit the network right before the Merge, figuring they can make more money by selling their gear than by waiting to get the last of the rewards. Too steep a drop in the network’s mining power, or the “hash rate,” could weaken Ethereum’s security, spelling disaster for its token and the various apps using the network. Ethereum’s core developers have planned for that scenario. “If we see the hash rate dropping, we could pull the Merge forward,” says Tim Beiko, a computer scientist who coordinates Ethereum developers. “All the software is built with an emergency option.”

Miners may also choose to fork Ethereum, by taking the existing proof-of-work software and continuing to support it. That would create two different versions of Ethereum that run in ­parallel: proof of work and proof of stake.

“We believe POW and POS will coexist for a period of time after the switch,” says Danni Zheng, vice president of BIT Mining, a mining provider that’s also expanding its staking services.

In this scenario, crypto exchanges and users could become confused about which chain’s Ether they’re holding or trading. Two networks will mean more work for app developers, says Dieter Shirley, chief technology officer at Dapper Labs, the maker of an Ethereum-based cat-breeding game, CryptoKitties.

“A contentious fork, it’s likely it would hasten our departure from the Ethereum ecosystem,” Shirley says. Dapper may consider moving CryptoKitties to its own blockchain, Flow, he says.

A fork, or at least a lot of public criticism, is exceedingly likely because many Ethereum miners don’t seem to know the Merge is coming. 
Ethereum developers communicate about the Merge on Discord and Telegram, messaging apps that many miners don’t use, Beiko says. Mining pools, which provide most of the transaction-­ordering on Ethereum today, take a percentage of the miners’ earnings, and it’s in their interest not to notify their members of the Merge so that mining continues at least until the network upgrade, he says.

“I am more concerned about the people who don’t even know this is happening, and they buy this $3,000 miner, and three months later it stops working,” Beiko says. “It would be a bad idea to start mining today.”

And some miners just don’t believe the Merge is really coming, because it’s been delayed in the past.

“There’s a lot of scepticism because Ethereum has promised proof of stake for five years,” Beiko says. “It’s hard to convince people that this time it’s for real.”

Shutting ethereum’s old chain will send shock waves through the cryptomining industry. Scrambling to find other uses for their equipment, miners will migrate their machines to other, similar chains such as Dogecoin, Litecoin, and Monero. The hash rate on those other chains will balloon by 5 to 10 times overnight, says Sam Doctor, chief strategy officer at Bitooda, a digital asset fintech company. Overall revenue for this type of mining could drop as much as 90%, pushing many miners out of business, he says.

U.S. miners will pursue clients outside the crypto industry, in areas such as artificial intelligence and genome sequencing, Doctor says. “But none of them have customer-acquisition experience.”

Investors may benefit from the Merge. The number of new coins issued on Ethereum as rewards for ordering transactions should decrease 50% to 90%, as the proof-of-stake chain will offer lower rewards, Beiko says.

In the next two years the amount of Ether that’s used for staking will probably increase from 8% to 80%, according to staking ­services provider Staked. That will reduce the Ether in circulation, potentially pushing up its value. 
Stakers will be able to use the Ether they receive as rewards for ordering transactions, but not the Ether that they stake—at least not until another software upgrade, expected six months or so after the Merge. Stakers are more likely to hold their Ether for the long term than miners, who often need to sell some to cover electricity costs, says Kyle Samani, co-founder of Multicoin Capital.

After the Merge, the energy consumption of Ethereum’s network should drop more than 99%. To order transactions on the new proof-of-stake network, a validator can use a high-end laptop instead of a server farm. The entire proof-of-stake ­Ethereum is expected to consume around 2.62 megawatts—about as much as a small town with 2,100 American homes. By contrast, current proof-of-work setup gobbles up the energy of a midsize country.

“Even my daughter has picked up the ‘NFTs are boiling the oceans’ hysteria,” says Ben Edgington, lead product owner at ­ConsenSys, which builds infrastructure for the Ethereum blockchain. “I expect that freeing ourselves from the negatives of proof of work will definitely help make applications like DeFi and NFTs much more socially acceptable, leading to significantly accelerated adoption.”

Much will depend on whether the Merge goes smoothly, of course. “If we do our jobs well, nobody will notice the moment that Ethereum moves from proof of work to proof of stake,” ­Edgington says.

Bitcoin fell as low as $42 760 in early Asia trading, dropping below $43 000 for the first time since March 24. ",7 Apr 2022  06:35,"Bitcoin fell for a fourth day as expectations for the biggest rise in US interest rates in three decades diminishes demand for riskier assets.

The correlation coefficient between the Bitcoin and US equities have climbed in the past 90 days as investors grow more risk adverse with the Federal Reserve pulling back on the pandemic era stimulus that is credited for helping to fuel the rise of crypto. Alternative coins such as Ether, XRP and Litecoin fell more than the original digital asset.

Bitcoin fell as low as $42 760 in early Asia trading, dropping below $43 000 for the first time since March 24. It is down about 7.4% this year. The declines in digital assets mirrored a broad equities selloff, with Japan’s Nikkei Index down 1.8%.



Altcoins have dipped further given their smaller market value and lower trading volume, which usually results in wider price swings. Cardano has fallen 9.1% over the past five days, while Solana is down 9.4%.

Bitcoin briefly surpassed $48 000 in late March to erase losses since year-end, spurring optimism that it would break out of the tight trading range in which it had been mired. Ether had been outperforming Bitcoin during the rebound due to its upcoming technical upgrade scheduled later this year.

Earlier, Billionaire crypto investor Michael Novogratz says that once the Fed takes a pause, Bitcoin could start to take off again.

Novogratz, who leads Galaxy Digital Holdings, predicted the central bank will remain “very hawkish for a while” due to high inflation, and will likely raise interest rates by 50 basis points soon. But as the economy slows down and the Fed steps back, “Bitcoin goes to the moon,” he said, repeating a popular crypto catchphrase.

Novogratz was speaking at the “Bitcoin 2022” conference in Miami, which kicked off on Wednesday with the unveiling of a bull statue that commemorates the city’s partiality toward cryptocurrencies and the digital-assets industry. The event has attracted more than 25 000 attendees.

‘You pretty quickly run out of really effective ways to make yourself happier by spending money.’ ",9 Apr 2022  00:16,"The Economic Club of New York has hosted kings, prime ministers, and presidents, as well as Amazon.com Inc.’s Jeff Bezos and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.’s Jamie Dimon. Central bankers’ comments at the 115-year-old organisation have moved markets. Sam Bankman-Fried, a 30-year-old cryptocurrency billionaire, is probably the first person to play a computer game while giving a talk.

As the featured guest one morning in February, Bankman-Fried looks schlubby as usual, reclining on a gaming chair in blue shorts and a grey T-shirt advertising his cryptocurrency exchange, FTX, his mop of curly hair flattened by his headphones. He’s speaking by Zoom from his office in the Bahamas.

Off camera, the detritus of someone who more or less lives at work litters his desk: crumpled bills from the US and Hong Kong, nine tubes of lip balm, a stick of deodorant, a 1.5‑pound canister of sea salt labeled “SBF’s salt shaker,” and an open packet of chickpea korma that he had for lunch the day before. The beanbag where his assistant says he sleeps most weekdays is so close he could practically roll onto it.

As he fields questions about how the US should regulate his industry, he pulls up a fantasy game called Storybook Brawl, chooses to play as “Peter Pants,” and prepares for battle with someone who goes by “Funky Kangaroo.”

“We’re anticipating a lot of growth in the United States,” Bankman-Fried says as he casts a spell on one of the knights in his fairy-tale army.

The novelty of appearances like this has long since worn off for Bankman-Fried, who’s testified before Congress twice since December. The previous weekend, he watched the Super Bowl from box seats just in front of NBA star Steph Curry—an FTX endorser. There was lunch with basketball legend Shaquille O’Neal and a party DJ’d by the head of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The singer Sia invited him to a dinner at a Beverly Hills mansion with Bezos and actor Leonardo DiCaprio, where Kate Hudson sang the national anthem and he chatted about crypto with pop star Katy Perry. The next day she told her 154 million followers on Instagram, in an unsolicited endorsement, “im quitting music and becoming an intern for @ftx_official ok”

Bankman-Fried is so blasé that he lets me watch his six screens over his shoulder as he fields the kind of messages that most executives protect like state secrets. Just that morning he appeared on NPR and emailed with reporters for Puck and the New York Times. His top Washington strategist wrote at one point to say that Senator Cory Booker, a Democrat from New Jersey, would sign on to his preferred approach to regulation. Bankman-Fried got a message saying MoneyGram International Inc. was for sale and spent a few seconds considering whether the company could be a good bet. An assistant informed him that the head of an investment bank was in the Bahamas and wanted to visit him for five minutes. “Meh,” Bankman-Fried wrote back. That evening he planned to fly to the Munich Security Conference for a meeting with the prime minister of Georgia.

Given the insane speed and riskiness of his climb to the top echelons of the financial world, almost anything else must seem low stakes by comparison. Five years ago, Bankman-Fried was working for a charitable organization that promoted the then-fringe idea of “effective altruism”: using scientific reasoning to figure out how to do the most good for the most people. Then he spotted a seemingly too-good-to-be-true pricing anomaly in Bitcoin and decided that, for him, the right path would be making tons of money to give away. Now, Bankman-Fried is one of the richest people in the world, with a fortune of more than $20 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, after venture capitalists recently invested in FTX and its US arm at a combined $40 billion valuation.

For all his wealth, Bankman-Fried tells me his core philosophy remains the same.

He’ll keep enough money to maintain a comfortable life: 1% of his earnings or, at minimum, $100 000 a year. Other than that, he still plans to give it all away—every dollar, or Bitcoin, as the case may be. 
He’s a kind of crypto Robin Hood, beating the rich at their own game to win money for capitalism’s losers. Yet he’s now part of the power structure that causes the problems he says he wants to fix. He makes big political contributions and pushes his company’s agenda in Washington. And so far he’s donated less to charity than he’s spent on naming rights for the Miami Heat’s arena (cost: $135 million over 19 years) and airing a Super Bowl ad with comedian Larry David portraying a curmudgeonly crypto skeptic (an estimated $30 million). He sees no inconsistency; he’s investing to maximize the amount of good he does, eventually, even if he’s risking what he’s already made in crypto.

As by far the richest person to emerge from the effective-altruism movement, Bankman-Fried is a thought experiment from a college philosophy seminar come to life. Should someone who wants to save the world first amass as much money and power as possible, or will the pursuit corrupt him along the way?

The way Bankman-Fried’s peers describe him, he sounds like a strange sort of capitalist monk. One says he worked so hard in the early days that he rarely showered. Another says he swore off relationships because he doesn’t have time. It seems like he views even sleep as an unnecessary luxury. “Every minute you spend sleeping is costing you X thousand dollars, and that directly means you can save this many less lives,” says Matt Nass, a colleague and childhood friend.

These days, Bankman-Fried lives in Nassau, the capital of the Bahamas. FTX is planning to build a 1,000-employee campus overlooking the ocean. For now it’s headquartered in a one-story red-roofed building near the airport. Desks are still labeled with names written on sticky notes, as if the roughly 60 people who work there haven’t had time to unpack. The day before his prestigious talk/Storybook Brawl gaming session, as I’m talking to his assistant in the break room, Bankman-Fried shuffles in shoeless, wearing white crew socks. “Oh, hey,” he says. We sit down later in a conference room. I ask him about his trip to the Super Bowl. “I don’t know if ‘fun’ is exactly the word I would use to describe it,” Bankman-Fried says, scratching an itchy patch on his arm. “Parties are not my scene.”

Bankman-Fried lives like a college student perpetually cramming for finals. He drives a Toyota Corolla, and when he’s not at the office, he crashes at an apartment with 10 or so roommates, though it’s a penthouse at the island’s nicest resort. Bankman-Fried figures as many as five of his co-workers are also billionaires. All are around his age. Friends say he calmly assesses the odds in any situation, whether it’s in the middle of a board-game marathon or after he’s been nudged awake on his beanbag to weigh in on a tricky trade. He tells me that, while he doesn’t like to waste time by economising, he doesn’t see much value in buying things.

“You pretty quickly run out of really effective ways to make yourself happier by spending money,” Bankman-Fried says. “I don’t want a yacht.” 
The crypto industry might seem like an odd choice for a do-gooder: It’s facilitated endless scams, turned ransomware into an industry, and sucks up tons of energy—as much as the country of Malaysia, by some estimates. Bankman-Fried doesn’t see it that way. He says FTX is running an honest market, checks customers’ backgrounds, buys carbon credits to offset its emissions, and is more efficient than the mainstream financial system. But it’s clear the main appeal for him is getting rich quick.

He smiles as he shares a chart that shows FTX growing faster than his largest competitors, such as Binance. The market is huge. FTX is only the No 3 crypto exchange by volume yet handles $15 billion of trading on a good day. Instead of shares of Microsoft Corp., users are buying and selling Bitcoin, Ether, Dogecoin, and hundreds of other weird cryptocurrencies.

Bankman-Fried has set his sights on the US market, which is dominated by Coinbase Global. He wants to offer cryptocurrency futures, swaps, and options, which he sees as a potential $25 billion-a-day market. If he succeeds in taking over crypto, the mainstream finance industry is next. “We’re sort of playing in the kiddie pool,” Bankman-Fried says. “Ideally, I would want FTX to become the biggest source of financial transactions in the world.”

The me-first ethics of the novelist Ayn Rand have been the inspiration of ruthless entrepreneurs from Uber Technologies Inc.’s Travis Kalanick to tech mogul Peter Thiel. Bankman-Fried’s capitalist muse is the utilitarian philosopher Peter Singer, a professor at Princeton and an animal-rights advocate. Bankman-Fried first came across Singer’s work when he was a teenager living in Berkeley, Calif. His parents are both Stanford law professors. His mother also runs an influential data-driven Democratic donor group, and his father trained as a clinical psychologist.

In writings since the 1970s, Singer has posed a deceptively simple ethical question: If you walked by a child drowning in a shallow pond, would you stop to pull her out, even if it would muddy your clothes? He then argued that if you’d do that—and who wouldn’t?—you have no less of a duty to save a faraway person from starvation by donating to an international aid group. Not giving large sums of money away is as bad as letting the child drown.

Bankman-Fried agrees, though he wasn’t always sure what to do about it. “It is very demanding, if you take it seriously,” he says. “But I do think it’s basically right. Like, if that’s the right thing to do, then I don’t want to deny that because it seems hard.” By 2012, when he was a junior studying physics at MIT, he described himself as a utilitarian like Singer and had become a vegan. He joined a coed fraternity called Epsilon Theta, where, instead of throwing keggers, members stayed up all night playing board games and slept in an attic full of bunk beds. Bankman-Fried recruited other “Thetans” to hand out pamphlets for an anti-factory-farm group.

That year, Bankman-Fried went to a talk by Will MacAskill, a 25-year-old doctoral student at Oxford who was trying to turn Singer’s ideas into a movement. He and his collaborators aimed to use mathematical calculations to figure out how individuals could do the most good with their money and time. They dubbed it “effective altruism.”

Over lunch, MacAskill told Bankman-Fried more about another one of his ideas: “earning to give.” He said that for someone of Bankman-Fried’s mathematical talents, it might make sense to pursue a high-paying job on Wall Street, then donate his earnings to charity. GiveWell, an effective-altruism group based in Oakland, Calif., says each $4,500 spent on insecticide-treated bed nets to fight malaria in Africa can save one life. MacAskill estimated at the time that a successful banker who donated half her income could save 10,000 lives over the course of a career.

MacAskill’s ideas are controversial. Some say the ends don’t justify the means—that Wall Street perpetuates inequality and undermines whatever good might be done by donations. (MacAskill argues that while altruists shouldn’t take jobs that harm society, much of finance is neutral.) Others say the movement flatters the rich by painting them as heroes and fails to address the root causes of poverty. “Effective altruism doesn’t try to understand how power works, except to better align itself with it,” Amia Srinivasan, an Oxford philosophy professor, wrote in a 2015 review of a book by MacAskill.

But MacAskill’s pitch appealed to the young utilitarian. MacAskill, laughing, remembers Bankman-Fried’s matter-of-fact response: “He basically said, ‘Yep, that makes sense.’ ”

Another MacAskill acolyte had gone to work for Jane Street Group, a high-frequency trading firm in New York. Bankman-Fried got a job there, too, and for three years after graduation, he worked as a trader and every year gave away about half of his six-figure salary to animal-welfare groups and other effective-altruism-approved charities. But he grew restless. He left for MacAskill’s Centre for Effective Altruism. Then he happened upon a cryptocurrency website and noticed something odd.

It was 2017, and crypto was in the middle of its first boom. The price of Bitcoin spiked 10 times that year, and investors sank almost $5 billion into hundreds of “initial coin offerings,” or ICOs, many of them barely concealed scams. Bankman-Fried, like many on Wall Street, didn’t understand crypto. What caught his attention was a page on CoinMarketCap.com that quoted prices from exchanges around the world.

Despite crypto proponents’ talk about a decentralized financial revolution, most activity relies on private exchanges to match buyers and sellers. People who want to buy Bitcoin or Litecoin or Ether simply send their dollars, yen, or euros to an exchange, trade back and forth for a while, and then withdraw their cash.

Bankman-Fried saw that certain coins were selling for way more on some exchanges than others. This was the kind of buy-low, sell-high arbitrage opportunity he’d learned to exploit at Jane Street. But there he’d built complex mathematical models for trades that aimed to make money off tiny price differences. On crypto exchanges, the discrepancies were hundreds of times bigger. “That’s too easy,” Bankman-Fried recalls thinking. “Something’s wrong.”

Some of the data were false, and some of the trades were impossible to pull off. Capital controls prevented traders from sending cash home from South Korea, where Bitcoin sold for 30% more than in the US But in Japan, which didn’t have those rules, Bitcoin still traded at a 10% premium. In theory, someone could earn 10% every day by buying Bitcoin on a US exchange and sending it to a Japanese one to sell. At that rate, in a little more than four months, $10,000 would turn into $1 billion.

Bankman-Fried recruited a few friends to help him with the project. There was Gary Wang, a housemate from MIT then working on flight data for Google; Caroline Ellison, a trader from Jane Street; and Nishad Singh, a friend of his younger brother’s who was then an engineer at Facebook. All were effective altruists who bought into Bankman-Fried’s pitch that this was their best chance to make and give away a lot of money. They moved into a three-bedroom house in Berkeley and dug into the arbitrage.

The obstacles to the trade were mainly practical. Bankman-Fried named his company Alameda Research to sound harmless. But US banks viewed cryptocurrency as so sketchy that some wouldn’t let him open an account. Japanese exchanges would allow only Japanese people to withdraw money in yen. So he opened a subsidiary in Japan and hired a local representative. Still, the business sounded fishy, and bank tellers would raise questions about his overseas wire transfers. He had so much trouble sending the money that he started calculating whether it made sense to charter a plane, fly to Japan, and have a planeload of people withdraw cash and bring it home. (It didn’t.)

Once Bankman-Fried found willing banks, each day became a race. If they didn’t wire the money out of Japan before the branch closed, they’d miss out on that day’s 10% return. Completing the cycle required the precision logistics of a heist movie. A team of people spent three hours a day in a US bank to ensure money transfers went through, and another team in Japan waited for hours at the front of the teller line when it was time to wire the money back. At the peak, Alameda was sending $15 million back and forth daily and generating a $1.5 million profit. Within a few weeks, before the price difference disappeared, the company had earned about $20 million.



Few bets paid off as easily, but there were others that came close. Compared with the stock market, crypto offered fat targets because ordinary investors were piling in, and only a handful of smart-money players were hunting for arbitrages. In 2018, Bankman-Fried went to a Bitcoin conference in Macau where he met some of the other big players in the market and decided to stay at the centre of the action. He told his colleagues on Slack that he wouldn’t be returning to Berkeley. Eventually, many of them joined him in Hong Kong, which has more permissive regulations than the US

By 2019, Alameda was throwing off hundreds of thousands of dollars of profit a day, enough, by effective altruists’ logic, to save a life every hour if Bankman-Fried had chosen to give the money to the right charities. Instead, he and his colleagues decided to reinvest their winnings, partly into building their own crypto exchange.

The marketplaces were in a sorry state. They were buggy, frequently crashing when prices plummeted or spiked. Some charged Alameda fees to compensate the exchanges for their own losses on margin loans to customers—a practice unheard of on the New York Stock Exchange. One of the largest, BitMEX, was under US investigation. (Two of its founders pleaded guilty in February to violations of the Bank Secrecy Act and face potentially yearslong prison sentences.)

It took Bankman-Fried’s crew four months to write the code underlying a new exchange, which opened for business in May 2019. FTX catered to big traders, offering dozens of different coins to bet on, complex derivatives like tokens with built-in leverage or index futures, and even bets on elections and stock prices. It offered margin loans, so traders could ramp up their returns—and risk. Customers could borrow up to 101 times their collateral—slightly higher leverage than offered by the competition. (FTX cut the limit to 20 times last year after criticism.) And, crucially, traders could put up cash as collateral to borrow any coin they wanted, which some rivals didn’t allow.

It was a hit, in part because so many people wanted to use the exchange to trade with Alameda. Daily trading volume reached $300 million by July of that year and an average of $1 billion in 2020. FTX takes a cut of two basis points (a basis point is one one-hundredth of 1% in Wall Street jargon) on most orders—that’s about $9 in fees to buy one Bitcoin for $45,000, the price in late March. That added up to revenue of $1.1 billion for the exchange last year, and about $350 million in profit, Bankman-Fried says. (Alameda, which he no longer runs day to day, made an additional $1 billion in profit in 2021 alone.) Dan Matuszewski, co-founder of the crypto investment fund CMS Holdings, says Bankman-Fried handled customer service at all times of day and solicited ideas for new things to trade. “They have colossal risk appetite,” says Matuszewski, who trades on FTX and also invested in the exchange. “They’ll try things that fail constantly. It’s calculated, and it’s smart.”

If Bankman-Fried had stayed in Berkeley, many of the bets FTX offered would’ve been not quite, well, legal. Gary Gensler, chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, says most cryptocurrencies should be regulated like stocks and exchanges such as FTX like traditional markets. Those that ignore the rules aren’t following the law, he says. “This asset class is rife with fraud, scams, and abuse,” Gensler said in a speech last year. “Right now, we just don’t have enough investor protection in crypto.”

FTX, incorporated in the Caribbean country of Antigua and Barbuda, initially barred Americans from trading, though many professionals such as Matuszewski were able to access it because they already controlled offshore companies.

But the US market for crypto is huge. Rival Coinbase generates more than $600 million a month in revenue, even though it offers only coins it argues don’t fall under SEC rules. In 2020, Bankman-Fried opened a US exchange with a limited menu of tokens to trade. He’s been on a marketing blitz for it since. On top of the Super Bowl commercial and naming the FTX Arena in Miami, he’s spent $210 million to sponsor a video-gaming team and signed up endorsers including quarterback Tom Brady, former Red Sox slugger David Ortiz, and tennis star Naomi Osaka. (FTX in March also acquired the company behind Storybook Brawl.) He’s now pushing Congress for new rules that would allow him to offer more coins and crypto derivatives.

He says the SEC should share oversight for crypto with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, generally viewed as more friendly to the industry. He’s hired a former CFTC commissioner as head of regulatory strategy, bought a derivatives exchange licensed by the agency, and made the maximum $5,800 donation to about a dozen members of Congress from both parties. (In 2020 he donated $5 million to a committee supporting Joe Biden, becoming one of the president’s biggest donors.) Perhaps unsurprisingly, he’s gotten a friendly reception when he’s gone to Washington. “I’m offended you have a much more glorious Afro than I once had,” Booker, the New Jersey senator, joked at a February hearing. Bankman-Fried says he’s trying to lay out a framework for federal oversight and move the debate away from extremes such as “ban it or let it go wild.”

Rohan Grey, a law professor at Willamette University who’s worked with Democrats to develop crypto regulations, says the market needs strict rules to protect consumers from fraud and prevent its swings from destabilising the broader financial system. In his view, lobbying like Bankman-Fried’s hinders those efforts. “Anytime people propose stronger regulations, people like him go out and try to prevent it from happening,” Grey says. “And, of course, big money talks.

Young tech entrepreneurs like Bankman-Fried have turned the effective-altruism movement into a force in philanthropy. More than 7,000 people have pledged at least 10% of their career earnings through a group run by the Centre for Effective Altruism. Dustin Moskovitz, a Facebook founder, donates hundreds of millions of dollars a year to charities the movement has identified as effective. Tesla Inc.’s Elon Musk enlisted a pro-poker-player-turned-effective-altruist to advise him on giving.

Bankman-Fried tells me he gave away $50 million last year, including to pandemic relief in India and anti-global-warming initiatives. This year he says he’ll donate at least a few hundred million and up to $1 billion, as much as the largest foundations. Like other effective altruists, Bankman-Fried has been drawn to threats that could lead to humanity’s extinction. In his view, something that has even a tiny chance of saving the lives of the trillions of people who might live in future generations can be more valuable than alleviating suffering today. Some dangers sound like science-fiction plotlines: rogue artificial intelligence, deadly bioweapons, and warfare in space. MacAskill, the effective-altruism movement founder, says Bankman-Fried was momentarily excited by the idea of buying up coal mines—both to prevent emissions and to keep fuel on hand in case it’s needed in a post-apocalyptic scenario. (He decided it wasn’t cost-effective.)

Bankman-Fried now says his top priority is pandemic preparedness. A future disease outbreak, he says, could be as lethal as Ebola and as contagious as Covid-19. He’s funding an advocacy group headed by his younger brother that’s pushing governments to spend more, and he gave $5 million to the nonprofit investigative journalism group ProPublica to cover the topic. “We should expect that pandemics will get worse over time and more frequent, just because of the possibility of lab leaks,” he says. “This has a nontrivial chance of destabilising the world if we don’t get prepared for it.”

I ask Bankman-Fried whether he ever has any doubt about dedicating his life completely to making money and giving it away. He presses his face in his hands for a few seconds before answering. “It’s not a decision that I constantly reevaluate, because I think it just doesn’t do me any good to be constantly reevaluating anything,” he says. “It doesn’t, minute to minute, feel to me like a decision anymore.”

Around 5 p.m. the day of the Economic Club talk, Bankman-Fried crashes, passing out first in his gaming chair, then curling up on the blue beanbag next to his desk, his elbow cradling his curly hair. The office is quiet, other than the clicking of employees chatting on Slack. Behind Bankman-Fried, a programmer examines some code, his feet up on his desk and his shorts stained with soy sauce. After about an hour, Bankman-Fried stirs, eats a package of Nutter Butters, then closes his eyes again. During his catnap, traders will swap about $500 million of Bitcoin, Ether, and other cryptocurrencies on his exchange, and FTX will skim off an additional $100,000 or so in fees.

This is a really fascinating interview into a world than didn’t exist five years ago. 
Essentially he’s operating his own Tobin Tax system. “A Tobin tax was originally defined as a tax on all spot conversions of one currency into another. It was suggested by James Tobin, an economist who won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. Tobin’s tax was originally intended to penalise short-term financial round-trip excursions into another currency.” 
The nice part is that a lot of profits go to worthy causes which probably offsets his tax burden. The other fascinating aspect is the way slicing and dicing has become more and more sophisticated with the advent of super high speed internet and computer algorithms/physics. This also means that the risk is exponentially high and it may also mean that within a nanosecond Mr Bank-Fried may actually find his bank fried ….
MW has my contact details and I look forward to spending it frivolously with quite a bit going to worthy causes.
“ You pretty quickly run out of really effective ways to make yourself happier by spending money.”
That is a refreshing take on crazy wealth.
After two nice homes, a yacht and a plane, and set aside an annuity to keep him comfortable for the rest of his life, people like him can get far more satisfaction from spending the rest on causes that make him feel good.
Imagine what great things fifty people with that attitude could achieve faster and more efficiently than governments. As an experiment they can fix a small country after a natural disaster. If they could keep the politicians out of the way…

A 30-year-old crypto billionaire wants to give his fortune away ",https://www.moneyweb.co.za/news/international/a-30-year-old-crypto-billionaire-wants-to-give-his-fortune-away/

Binance and Sky Mavis did not put a figure on how much of the $150 million Binance would provide. ",7 Apr 2022  12:31,"Crypto exchange Binance is leading investors’ contribution to a bailout of victims of a $615 million digital coin theft, the company targeted in the heist said on Wednesday.

The Vietnam-based company Sky Mavis, which runs the game Axie Infinity, said last week it had been hit by one of the largest crypto heists on record, leaving users unable to withdraw their money from the game.

        //poool('config', 'user_is_premium', false );

Sky Mavis said it would reimburse the lost money through a combination of its own balance sheet funds and $150 million raised by investors including cryptocurrency exchange Binance and venture capital firm a16z.

“Sky Mavis is committed to reimbursing all of our users’ lost funds and implementing rigorous internal security measures to prevent future attacks,” said Trung Nguyen, CEO of Sky Mavis.

The part of the network which was hacked, a blockchain “bridge” called Ronin, which allows users to move funds in and out of the game, will reopen after a security upgrade and audits which “can take several weeks”, Sky Mavis said.

The “funding round” will allow users to withdraw and deposit their money, the company said.

Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said “we strongly believe Sky Mavis will bring a lot of value and growth for the larger industry and we believe it’s necessary to support them as they work hard to resolve the recent incident.”

Binance and Sky Mavis did not put a figure on how much of the $150 million Binance would provide.

Sky Mavis’s game, Axie Infinity, allows its 2.2 million players to buy and trade in-game assets in the form of NFTs, which they compete against each other to earn crypto tokens.

“While racing for mainstream adoption, we made some trade-offs that ended up leaving us vulnerable to this sort of attack,” a blog post on the Axie Infinity website announcing the fundraise said. “It’s a lesson that we’ve learned the hard way.”

Hacks have long plagued the $2.1 trillion crypto sector, which saw an influx of investment during the Covid-19 pandemic.

In February, a crypto platform called Wormhole lost $320 million in what was one of the largest crypto heists on record at the time. The cryptocurrency arm of Jump Trading, which had recently acquired Wormhole’s developer, provided funds to replace the stolen money.

Crypto exchange Binance among investors to bail out victims of $615m heist ",https://www.moneyweb.co.za/moneyweb-crypto/bitcoin/crypto-exchange-binance-among-investors-to-bail-out-victims-of-615m-heist/

Amassing a collection of Bored Ape Yacht Club nonfungible tokens in a bet on the growing lure of digital collectibles. ",8 Apr 2022  16:02,"Two former Barclays Plc traders have swapped junk bonds for unique computerised art, amassing a collection of Bored Ape Yacht Club nonfungible tokens in a bet on the growing lure of digital collectibles.

Ovie Faruq and Mike Anderson, former high-yield cash and derivatives traders, have amassed 70 images of apes in various states of boredom, and three Damien Hirst NFTs, among other digital images. They wouldn’t reveal the value of their collection, or specific ID addresses, citing security concerns, but a Sotheby’s auction in September of similar images gives a ballpark figure. A lot of 101 Bored Ape tokens was sold for $24.4 million — and valuations have increased since.

        //poool('config', 'user_is_premium', false );
        //poool('send','page-view', 'free');
    

“It’s an illiquid market with large price swings, so much of the same discipline and skill around trading high-yield and distressed assets are transferable,” Anderson told Bloomberg News in a joint interview with his business partner. Both traders left Barclays in December, almost a year after they started to collect NFTs.

A cousin of the cryptocurrency market, NFTs, or digital collectibles, have soared in value in recent years, drawing investment from venture capitalists such as Andreessen Horowitz. The NFT market will approach $30 billion in value this year and reach $80 billion in 2025, forecasts Stephanie Wissink, an equity analyst at Jefferies.

The Bored Ape Yacht Club tokens, which have been limited to 10,000, have been at the forefront of the NFT craze, rising several times in value since their release in April 2021 and by 73% this year, according to CoinGecko, a cryptocurrency aggregator. Owners also get “airdropped,” a kind of reward system, which includes other NFTs and so-called ApeCoins. The market, though, remains volatile and fraught with risks.

The U.K. government followed the trend this week when the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak directed the state-owned Royal Mint to create an NFT, which is expected to be rolled out this summer.

Faruq likened the NFT craze to the boom and bust cycle of the dot-com era in the late 1990s, whose results continue to shape the investment world decades later. Faruq and Anderson said that their phones “blew up” with interest when other bankers found out that they left their jobs to pursue NFT investing full-time.

“In the dot-com bubble you saw 90% of companies go bust, but the 10% that survived are some of the world’s biggest companies,” he said. “It will be the same for crypto and NFTs, and we’re focused on utilizing our skillset to find the 10%.”

According to OpenSea, a NFT marketplace, prices for Bored Ape Yacht Club tokens first surged above 100 ether ($329,183) in January. Their values have largely fluctuated since, and over the last seven days averaged 118.75 ether, with a transaction volume on this platform of about $18.5 million in the past week.

That said, the value of digital art is still tricky to pin down — most transactions on the LooksRare platform show users selling tokens to themselves in a bid to earn more rewards. On the other hand, a copy of the first-ever tweet — by Twitter Inc. co-founder Jack Dorsey — has been offered for almost $48 million on OpenSea, 16 times what the owner paid for it a year ago.

NFTs use blockchain to create a digital signature that make them unique. They have come under closer scrutiny recently after a string of NFT projects faltered and essentially died, sparking memories of the ‘Initial Coin Offering’ bust of 2018, when thousands of digital tokens quickly lost value.

There’s a lot of work to be done to develop the market. The partners are seeking to invest in “seed opportunities” in web3 startups — a phrase used to describe the blockchain-driven internet for a decentralised economy. They’re interested in companies seeking to build infrastructure for the digital world, including crypto tokens with a focus on play to earn models, where participants take part in online games for digital payouts.

One of the partners, Faruq, has even dabbled in creating digital art.

“I’ve also started creating and selling crypto art myself,” he said. “I used to do a lot of artwork and coding when I was younger, so it’s been nice to rediscover these interests.”

Reserve Bank, Intergovernmental Fintech Working Group complete proof-of-concept project on policy and regulatory implications of distributed-ledger-driven innovation in financial markets. ",6 Apr 2022  14:53,"South African policymakers, legislators and regulators need more engagement with the fintech industry before distributed-ledger technology can be incorporated into the nation’s financial markets, according to a new report by the central bank and the Intergovernmental Fintech Working Group.

A distributed ledger is a digital record of transactions and contracts maintained in a decentralised form across different locations.

        poool('config', 'widget_container', '#poool-widget');
        //poool('config', 'user_is_premium', false );
        //poool('send','page-view', 'free');
    

The technology underpins cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and is being experimented with in large parts of the global financial system. 
With legislative reforms in the payment system underway in South Africa, it’s an opportune time to consider how to treat distributed ledger-based platforms and the use of tokenisation in financial markets, though efforts should be made to ensure rules are technology-neutral, principle-based and borne out of collaboration, the Reserve Bank and the working group said in a statement Wednesday.

The two bodies have completed a joint proof-of-concept project exploring the policy and regulatory implications of distributed-ledger-driven innovation in financial markets.

“The insights gained through practical exploration should lead to greater regulatory clarity – both for innovators and for regulators – and should be in the broader interest of ensuring a level playing field for all market participants,” Governor Lesetja Kganyago said in an online speech.

Regulators should move with caution when considering developments before amending rules and should be “fully appreciative” that regulated entities need clarity to committing to distributed-ledger markets, he said.

Under the experiment dubbed Project Khoka 2, the central bank and working group issued, cleared and settled debentures using distributed-ledger technology and tokenized money to inform policy and regulatory reflections. 
The working group included the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and South Africa’s top four banks: Absa Group, FirstRand Bank, Nedbank Group and Standard Bank Group.

To operate a distributed-ledger technology-based financial system, new capabilities are needed across all role players and new platforms will need to be integrated with legacy systems, the central bank and working group said said. The costs of such a move – that ought to be borne by all market players – will have to be offset against potential benefits, new standards, best practices and a supporting ecosystem will also have to be put in place.

“A transition to a DLT-based system requires careful planning and execution and may involve running a DLT-based system in parallel to the existing system for a while, perhaps indefinitely,” they said.

As the UK lender wades further into the $800 billion virtual reality market.  ",9 Apr 2022  09:22,"HSBC Holdings has launched a fund for metaverse opportunities for its private banking clients in Hong Kong and Singapore, as the UK lender wades further into the $800 billion virtual reality market.

The discretionary portfolio managed by HSBC Asset Management focuses on investing in companies within the metaverse ecosystem and “aims to capture the growth opportunities globally over the next decade,” the London-based bank said in a statement.

HSBC last month made its debut in the metaverse after buying a site aimed at sports, esports and gaming enthusiasts, joining Wall Street giant JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. in dipping its toe in the virtual universe. The bank is pushing further into the the crypto and blockchain ecosystem even as Chief Executive Officer Noel Quinn has previously said the bank has no plans to start a cryptocurrency trading desk or sell digital currencies as an investment to customers.

The metaverse blends aspects of digital technologies including video-conferencing, games like Minecraft or Roblox, cryptocurrencies, email, virtual reality, social media and live-streaming.

“The metaverse is seen by many as the next stage in the evolution of the internet, with the effect it has on our daily lives expected to be as impactful as we saw in the early nineties,” Nicholas Dowell, portfolio manager at HSBC Asset Management in London, said in the statement.
