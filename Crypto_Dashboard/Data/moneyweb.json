        "article": " The big crypto news of the week was the rupturing of TerraUSD\u2019s supposed peg to the US dollar. TerraUSD is a so-called algorithmic stablecoin supported by some fancy technology that was designed to maintain its value at $1. That 1:1 peg broke dramatically this week, with TerraUSD falling to $0.23 before recovering to $0.48 on Friday. TerraUSD (UST) occupies a subset within the crypto space known as stablecoins, which are a form of cryptos backed by real assets. Most are backed by fiat currencies such as the US dollar, others are linked to metals such as gold. Stablecoins have surged in popularity because their value is stable, unlike Bitcoin and other cryptos which are prone to wild speculative moves. Read: The combined value of all stablecoins hit $180 billion in March this year, in part because of a shift out of volatile cryptos not backed by real assets \u2013 such as Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2013 into more stable assets. Many traders swap their Bitcoin for stablecoins when they expect crypto prices to drop. The reason they opt for stablecoins such as UST is that it is cheaper than switching into fiat US dollars, and they harbour the belief that they are fully redeemable for USD at all times. Read: That belief has been shattered this week. Another US dollar-backed stablecoin, Tether (USDT), briefly lost its peg to the US dollar on Thursday, May 12, falling to $0.97 before rallying to $1 \u2013 where it should be. Rumours swirled that the world\u2019s largest asset manager, Blackrock, and hedge fund giant Citadel Securities, had a role in the TerraUSD collapse \u2013 rumours that were swiftly denied by the companies. Rumors that we had a role in the collapse of UST are categorically false. In fact, BlackRock does not trade UST. \u2014 BlackRock (@BlackRock)  There was speculation that Blackrock and Citadel had borrowed 100\u00a0000 BTC from Gemini, a crypto exchange, swapped 25% of this for UST and then dumped both BTC and UST, causing both to collapse in price, in what has been likened to a George Soros-style attack by Wall Street on the crypto market. BTC crashed to a 16 month low of $28\u00a0600 following the rout, before rallying to $28\u00a0600. Read/listen:  There\u2019s no doubt that stablecoins are here to stay, but the manner in which they are regulated will need closer attention. The largest of the stablecoins is Tether (USDT), backed 1:1 by the US dollar, and now the third largest crypto by market cap, with a total value of $81 billion. Just behind USDT is USD Coin, also backed 1:1 by the US dollar, and worth $49 billion. Then there\u2019s Binance USD (BUSD), the seventh largest crypto by market cap, and worth $17 billion. All of the above are known a centralised stablecoins, because they operate much like their own central banks, minting and burning coins as demand rises and falls. TerraUSD is decentralised in that multiple players participate in providing liquidity. Until recently, TerraUSD was the ninth largest crypto with a total market cap of $24 billion. It\u2019s now slipped to 17th place with a market cap of just $5.6 billion. It operated on an entirely different technology, comprising two separate cryptos: Luna and Terra. This is where the algorithm came into play. TerraUSD was theoretically always worth $1, while Luna, its sibling crypto, has no fixed price. If the value of TerraUSD exceeds $1, the equivalent value of Luna is burned. If TerraUSD dropped below $1 to say $0.98, arbitrage traders would snatch it up and sell for $1 worth of Luna. That was supposed to ensure the UST retained its peg to $1.  This is an ingenious methodology for maintaining the peg to the dollar, since it did not require the same amount of capital backing as other \u201ccentralised stablecoins\u201d, which are audited to show that they have $1 in real assets (either in fiat currencies, treasuries or other liquid assets). In UST\u2019s case, a piece of computer code maintains the peg. \u201cUnfortunately, this chink in the Terra network\u2019s design has managed to bring what was a multibillion-dollar project close to zero within days. It also caused systemic risk across DeFi (decentralised finance) and the broader crypto industry,\u201d  Ahmen Ismail, CEO of Fluid, a DeFi liquidity aggregator. Paolo Ardoino, Tether\u2019s chief technology officer, says the company has toyed with algorithmic stablecoins, but erred on the side of caution because of the potential for the kind of fallout that hit TerraUSD this week. \u201cThe reason we have always been careful in algorithmic stablecoins was exactly this problem, that if you have assets that are backing this stablecoin, and these assets are subject to heavy volatility, then you are (at) risk of having to liquidate your assets very quickly, and bringing the market even further down,\u201d he told the Wolf of All Streets podcast. Tether and USDC survived the carnage, and maintained their peg to the USD, though there were arbitrage opportunities between different exchanges in recent days, where Tether was available at less than $1 on crypto exchange Kraken. These could be snapped up and sold on other exchanges for $1, making a 1-2% return for sharp-eyed traders. As stablecoins hit the $10-$20 billion value mark, the potential for rupture is ever present. Below that level, they are perhaps too small for any kind of sneak attack. Do Kwon, the CEO of Terraform Labs, the company behind TerraUSD, was reported to be working on a rescue, but it seems certain the stablecoin is doing to have to transition to a more conventional form of asset backing if it is to survive. Ismail points out that these are the growing pains of a new, and illiquid market. Cryptos are still a tiny part of the broader financial market. There will be more such events. As liquidity improves, volatility will decline. What\u2019s needed to bring some order to this market is regulation \u2013 spelling out what a stablecoin is and is not, and where it fits into the financial eco-system, with liquidity aggregators capable of mobilising far larger gobs of capital when needed to prevent this kind of meltdown.

        "article": " On Wednesday, the implosion of the TerraUSD stablecoin kindled wide-spread panic in the crypto space. But 24 hours later, things have calmed down significantly. Terraform Labs halted, restarted and then halted again its Terra blockchain in the wake of the collapse of TerraUSD and its related Luna token. Developers who work on the blockchain said in a tweet posted to their verified Twitter account that the second halt was intended to enable them to \u201ccome up with a plan to reconstitute\u201d the network. Both TerraUSD (UST), the algorithmic stablecoin that lost and never regained its 1-1 peg to the US dollar, and the associated Luna token were trading near zero at the time of the second halt. But elsewhere in crypto sentiment had started to rebound. Tether, the largest stablecoin used in cryptocurrency markets to facilitate trading, recovered from an earlier mini-crash, soothing concerns that its troubles might spill into the broader market. Tokens underpinning key decentralised finance protocols also advanced. Even ApeCoin rallied, advancing more than 35% in 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.com. Bitcoin, meanwhile, traded above $30 000 after falling to about $25 000 in the previous day\u2019s trading. And some alternative coins also gained, with Bitcoin Cash adding 20% at one point before paring gains. It\u2019s a remarkably more positive picture from the havoc that overtook crypto markets on Wednesday as UST entered a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d. That day, Bitcoin had suffered a nearly 10% drop. \u201cThe fact that Tether is stabilising means that the margin calls that took place are fading,\u201d said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co. \u201cWhenever you get forced selling in anything, it overshoots. People are still nervous, but the selling has abated. Investors will be nervous for a few more days, but the supply-demand equation has stabilised again.\u201d  Market-watchers noted that Bitcoin, which typically trades in tandem with the stock market, was able to gain on Thursday even as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 sunk 0.1% and 0.2%, respectively. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, meanwhile, said Terra\u2019s tumble showed the dangers of tokens that purport to be pegged to the US dollar, though she added that its implosion didn\u2019t pose a threat to financial stability. \u201cCrypto has little economic significance. Not that many people own much of it,\u201d said Brian Nick, chief investment strategist at Nuveen. Still, he added that the crypto market is being swayed by the same forces that are affecting equities right now. \u201cWhat gets punished when financial conditions are tightening? Anything with a high valuation and an uncertain or non-existent revenue stream,\u201d he said by phone. \u201cAnd crypto has inarguably high valuations and no revenue stream. That\u2019s very much of a piece with what we\u2019re seeing in growth stocks, tech. It\u2019s correlated but obviously it\u2019s more volatile because the market is less liquid.\u201d Various trading desks reported business-as-usual conditions, with B2C2 saying it saw two-way flows into UST, and more buying in USDC. Stephane Ouellette, chief executive of FRNT Financial Inc., said he\u2019d received questions about Tether, with clients wondering if its dislocation provided any arbitrage opportunities. \u201cLast night there was a huge arb,\u201d he said, adding that \u201ceverything at Tether and Bitfinex appears to be working as usual.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no indication there\u2019s anything going wrong there at all besides the market move, which is now looking like it was circumstantial,\u201d he said. Still, cryptocurrencies remain mired in a deep downturn. \u201cThe question, as always, is: now what?,\u201d wrote Michael Purves, chief executive and founder of Tallbacken Capital Advisors. He expects further downside for Bitcoin and is looking at the coin potentially hitting $20 000 or $15 000. \u201cA move to 15K would be a move off the January levels which would be quite consistent with the last three long term momentum reversals we have seen,\u201d he said in a note. \u201cHowever, bears should be prepared for aggressive relief rallies along the way (just as they should with equities).\u201d",

Bitcoin plunged by as much as 10% in the last day to its lowest level since Dec. 2020, while Ethereum dropped as much as 16%.

        "article": " Stablecoins besides TerraUSD are failing to live up to their billing as the collapse of the algorithmic token has investors pondering the implications of the tumult for the broader market. Most rival algorithmic stablecoins, which use a complex combination of computer code and trader incentives to maintain their pegs of one-to-one to the dollar, are also below that threshold \u2013 though not at the 80% extreme seen on TerraUSD on Wednesday. Read: MakerDAO\u2019s Dai slipped 0.4% before recovering to its peg and Fei slipped 0.5%. Neutrino USD fell 20% over the same period of time, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Tether, the biggest stablecoin which claims to be backed by actual assets including dollars, was trading slightly off its dollar peg at around 97 cents at 8 a.m. in London, data compiled by Bloomberg show. USDC, the second largest, was basically holding its peg. \u201cAlgorithmic stablecoins are at an experimental stage currently, nothing more,\u201d said Dan Liebau, chief investment officer for Modular Asset Management\u2019s blockchain strategy. Those backed by an increasing/decreasing amount in the stablecoin\u2019s own protocol token comprise a \u201cparticularly risky category,\u201d he added. Read: TerraUSD, or UST, and its related token Luna, had a long way to fall. They both recently climbed into the top 10 tokens by market value after Terra founder Do Kwon established the Luna Foundation Guard, which bought billions of dollars of Bitcoin to back it up. Terra founder Do Kwon is counting on the oldest cryptocurrency as a backstop for his stablecoin, which some critics liken to a ginormous Ponzi scheme. Image: Bloomberg Investors had rushed to take advantage of yields that might reach almost 20% on Anchor Protocol, which is powered by the Terra blockchain. On Wednesday, Kwon announced measures aimed at bringing TerraUSD back to the $1 peg, which includes minting Luna at an increased pace. The total circulating supply of Luna has surged to 1.46 billion tokens from 377 million yesterday, data from researcher Messari show.  \u201cThe effects of the UST collapse will bring a bit more caution while evaluating for other algorithmic stablecoins for investment,\u201d said Paul Veradittakit, a partner at Pantera Capital in Menlo Park, California. Also, apps built on Terra/Luna \u201cwill likely want to diversify platforms to mitigate risk and apps that are tapping into Anchor for yields will have to tap into other cryptocurrencies and liquidity protocols.\u201d TerraUSD isn\u2019t the first algorithmic stablecoin whose peg has blown up. Neutrino, which sought to keep at equilibrium by issuing and burning tokens, lost its peg last month. It happened to Iron Finance last June \u2013 an incident that caused Dallas Mavericks owner and crypto fan Mark Cuban to call for regulation defining what a stablecoin is, and what collateralisation is acceptable. \u201cWe do not believe that the UST situation means anything for the centralised stablecoin market,\u201d a statement from Tether said. \u201cThey are entirely different types of assets.\u201d    ",

        "article": " It\u2019s been a long few weeks since the crypto crowd was partying in Miami. Coinbase Global Inc. founder Brian Armstrong had a personal fortune of $13.7 billion as recently as November and about $8 billion at the end of March. That\u2019s now just $2.2 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, after a selloff in digital currencies from Bitcoin to Ether triggered a precipitous decline in the market value of Coinbase, the largest US cryptocurrency exchange. The firm\u2019s shares have tumbled 84% since their first day of trading in April 2021, closing Wednesday at $53.72 after the company warned that trading volume and monthly transacting users were expected to be lower in the second quarter than in the first. It\u2019s raised questions about Coinbase\u2019s ability to withstand the sharp decline in crypto prices, forcing Armstrong to take to Twitter to defend the company. There is \u201cno risk of bankruptcy\u201d even amid a \u201cblack swan\u201d event and users\u2019 funds are safe, said Armstrong, the firm\u2019s chief executive officer. Then there\u2019s Michael Novogratz. The CEO of crypto merchant bank Galaxy Digital has seen his fortune plummet to $2.5 billion, from $8.5 billion in early November. He\u2019s been a champion of TerraUSD, the algorithmic stablecoin that\u2019s now at risk of a complete collapse amid a breakdown in the price of a crypto token in the same ecosystem, Luna. \u201cI\u2019m probably the only guy in the world that\u2019s got both a Bitcoin tattoo and a Luna tattoo,\u201d Novogratz said at the Bitcoin 2022 conference in Miami on April 6. I\u2019m officially a Lunatic!!! Thanks  And thank you my friends at Smith Street Tattoos. \u2014 Mike Novogratz (@novogratz) Billionaire crypto fortunes that swelled over the last two years are disappearing after a selloff that began with tech stocks spilled over into digital money. Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, and Ether have both fallen more than 50% since their record highs late last year. While almost all crypto holders have suffered wealth declines, some of the biggest and most visible losses are concentrated among founders of exchanges, where traders buy and sell digital currencies. At least on paper, Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of closely held Binance, has lost an even larger fortune than Armstrong or Novogratz. He debuted on the Bloomberg wealth index in January with a net worth of $96 billion, one of the world\u2019s largest. By Wednesday that had shrunk to $11.6 billion, using the average enterprise value to sales multiples of Coinbase and Canadian crypto firm Voyager Digital as a basis for the calculations. Crypto exchanges in the US appear to be suffering more of a downturn than their global competitors. Trading volumes at Coinbase have steadily fallen since the beginning of the year, while more internationally focused Binance saw an uptick in volume last month. Binance\u2019s US-focused business, by comparison, experienced even steeper declines than Coinbase\u2019s.  Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, co-founders of rival crypto exchange Gemini, have each lost about $2.2 billion \u2014 or roughly 40% \u2014 of their wealth this year. The fortune of Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of crypto exchange FTX, has fallen by half since the end of March to about $11.3 billion. Armstrong isn\u2019t the only Coinbase billionaire losing money. Co-founder Fred Ehrsam, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. trader, is currently worth $1.1 billion, down more than 60% this year. Armstrong owns 16% of Coinbase and controls 59.5% of its voting shares, according to the company\u2019s 2022 proxy statement, while Ehrsam has a 4.5% stake and controls 26% of its voting stock. Coinbase\u2019s bonds have also plunged, recently trading in line with some of the riskiest junk-rated notes.",

        "article": " Cryptocurrencies resumed declines as the collapse of the TerraUSD stablecoin triggers a flight from many popular digital tokens. Bitcoin shed as much as 4.9% on Thursday in Asia, falling to $27 003 and returning to levels last seen in December 2020. Tokens like Avalanche and Solana that underpin some key decentralised finance protocols also retreated. Earlier they had posted double-digit percentage gains but the rally fizzled. The TerraUSD stablecoin was still below it $1 intended peg, while the affiliated token Luna tumbled. The crypto sector overall is nursing heavy losses for the week and sentiment remains fragile. The TerraUSD algorithmic stablecoin \u2014 also known as UST \u2014 has been bouncing between 20 cents and 90 cents and was around 70 cents as of 12:28 p.m. in Singapore. Backers of the coin are trying to raise about $1.5 billion to shore up the token after it crashed from its dollar peg, according to the founder of a firm that was approached about the deal. \u201cThe downfall of the stablecoin UST has impacted the crypto market to a great extent,\u201d said Edul Patel, chief executive officer of Mudrex, an algorithm-based crypto investment platform. While Bitcoin has often rebounded quickly from crashes in the past, this time it could have further to fall, he added.  \u201cIs the market getting spooked by what\u2019s happening with Terra? The answer is yes,\u201d Craig W. Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Sandler, said by phone. \u201cMoney-market funds are important to investors and right now we\u2019re questioning the third-largest money-market fund in crypto land. People did not think we were going to break the buck on that and that\u2019s clearly happened.\u201d Crypto sentiment was also hurt by elevated US inflation, which points to aggressive interest-rate hikes \u2014 an unfavorable environment for risk assets. \u201cThere is extreme fear across the crypto market,\u201d said Marcus Sotiriou, an analyst at the UK-based digital-asset broker GlobalBlock. The area around $30 000 had been an \u201cespecially sensitive zone,\u201d for Bitcoin, wrote James Malcolm, head of foreign exchange and crypto research at UBS. That\u2019s where mining economics turn negative, \u201cwhich could potentially lead to increased coin sales by this key cohort,\u201d he said.  Meanwhile, Coinbase Global Inc. shares and bonds fell to new lows Wednesday, signaling investor skepticism about the prospects of the crypto exchange in a bear-market. The company reported lower-than-expected revenues yesterday, and warned trading volume and monthly transacting users in the second quarter is expected to be lower than in the first. Piper Sandler\u2018s Johnson says that\u2019s another concern for crypto investors right now. \u201cIt\u2019s the largest exchange here in the United States and they just turned a loss,\u201d he said, adding that Terra\u2019s troubles are all \u201csnowballing in crypto land.\u201d Still, a lot of crypto investors, cognizant of the fact that Bitcoin has gone through a boom-and-bust cycle before only to recoup losses over and over again, are preaching patience. \u201cUltimately every investor needs to size positions based on their risk level and time horizon,\u201d said Alex Tapscott, managing director of the digital asset group at Ninepoint Partners. \u201cWe believe Bitcoin will recover and that we\u2019re still in the early stages of this new internet of value.

Until recently, the popular NFT collection has generally fared better than the rest of the crypto sphere. Its floor price hit an all-time high at the end of April, according to NFT Price Floor data. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is down by more than 50% since its all-time high in early November. \u201cThere have been substantial portfolios of NFTs built in the last six months,\u201d said Michael Bucella, a partner at BlockTower Capital Advisors, in an interview with Bloomberg. But BAYC\u2019s recent fall from favour seems to reflect a wider trend spreading across the marketplace for nonfungible tokens. The JPG NFT Index, which provides exposure to a broad basket of NFTs, also fell by about 26% this past week. \u201cThey are just fairly illiquid markets generally,\u201d said Bucella. \u201cIf the market is selling off en masse, they are going to sell whatever they have.\u201d In comparison, crypto bellwether Bitcoin tumbled 17% and Ether is down 15% over the last week, according to CoinMarketCap. Token prices were seen slipping during the recent selloff in tech stocks in traditional markets and as troubles surrounding TerraUSD, an algorithmic stablecoin meant to be pegged to the US dollar, have come to light. NFT-backed loans, which allow borrowers to put up their digital artwork as collateral in order to obtain funds, may also be contributing to the recent nosedive in NFT sales. \u201cThis could be just collateral selldowns to satisfy loan obligations,\u201d said Bucella. \u201cIf you had folks taking some pretty significant hits on their assets, there\u2019s a potential loan unwind.\u201d",

        "article": " The plunge in TerraUSD, or UST, has reignited the debate over algorithmic stablecoins, a subject of controversy within the crypto industry. It crashed to around 45 cents on Wednesday, days after breaking an intended 1-to-1 peg to the dollar, as confidence in the project evaporated. Cashaa is among prospective investors that received the proposal from the Luna Foundation Guard, Gaurav said, adding that his firm won\u2019t participate. Investors will be subject to a one-year lockup and a monthly \u201clinear vest\u201d over 12 months, he added. The LFG didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment. \u201cUST\u2019s collapse is the biggest threat to crypto right now,\u201d said Gaurav. \u201cIt has massive ramifications across the entire industry. If UST stays below peg for enough time, it could cause even more Luna to be minted and sold to the market, increasing the risk of UST\u2019s solvency.\u201d The Block reported on the fundraising plans earlier. Broader crypto markets showed few signs of getting caught up in the turmoil on Wednesday, with stablecoins like Tether holding their pegs and major tokens including Bitcoin and Ether trading higher. Read: Do Kwon, the main backer behind TerraUSD, said in a\u00a0\u00a0on Wednesday that he had endorsed a proposal to increase minting capacity of UST and Luna on the Terra blockchain from $293 million to $1.2 billion, arguing that this would \u201callow the system to absorb the UST more quickly.\u201d \u201cBefore anything else, the only path forward will be to absorb the stablecoin supply that wants to exit before $UST can start to repeg. There is no way around it,\u201d he said, noting that this effort would come at \u201ca high cost\u201d to all holders of TerraUSD and Luna. Kwon said options are being explored to bring in outside capital, without providing details. Unlike conventional stablecoins like Tether\u2019s USDT or Circle\u2019s USDC that are backed by real-world highly liquid cash equivalents or dollars, algorithmic tokens are designed to maintain their peg (and investor confidence) through a combination of mathematical equations and active trading. In the case of UST, investors can exchange one unit of the token, no matter what price it\u2019s currently trading at, for $1 worth of Luna. The embedded arbitrage trade helps keep UST at or close to $1, or so the theory goes. Members of Anchor, a lending project built on the Terra blockchain, on Wednesday proposed temporarily cutting its interest rate to a minimum of 3.5%. Anchor has been the main driver of UST demand on Terra. It previously offered an interest rate of nearly 20% to those who deposit UST on its protocol. Falling yields on Anchor may lead to \u201csignificant\u201d outflows from UST, which in turn impacts the supply of Luna and its price, said Kunal Goel, an analyst at Messari. That creates a vicious circle by increasing pressure on UST as less funds back the stablecoin, he said. \u201cThere is not enough demand for Luna because Luna holders know they will get diluted to pay off UST holders\u2019 debt,\u201d Goel said. \u201cUST holders want to exit because they understand that their debt is not supported without the demand for Luna and sufficient reserves. That\u2019s the death spiral we\u2019re in.\u201d \u00a9\u00a02022\u00a0Bloomberg L.P.",

        "article": " TerraUSD, the struggling and controversial algorithmic stablecoin, plunged on Wednesday as crypto markets await a rescue led by primary backer Do Kwon. The token plunged from its intended 1-to-1 peg to the US dollar to trade at around 40 cents at 9:10 a.m. in London, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  TerraUSD, or UST, is the biggest algorithmic stablecoin by market value. Over the weekend, the token lost its intended peg to the US dollar, falling to about 99 cents. A wave of selling followed, and by Monday evening UST had hit an all-time low of 60 cents. On Tuesday, following an earlier tweet from Kwon that he was \u201cclose to announcing a recovery plan,\u201d the token traded off the lows and rallied to a high of around 94 cents.
